Reddit.com Modlog report generator 

This is a slightly modified version of [DEADBEEF](http://www.reddit.com/user/DEADB33F)'s userscript that allows a moderator to generate a table report of moderation activity in a subreddit.

I changed the interval selection inputs into type="text" to make it work in Chrome and other browsers that have native data-pickers that break the original script.
